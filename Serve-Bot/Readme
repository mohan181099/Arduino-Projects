Technology: Arduino Mega Board, Infrared Sensor, DC Motors.,
Description: It is a line follower robot which was developed to help 
the people in old-age homes and also covid affected patients for 
supplying their requirements. We have used Arduino Mega as the 
main controller and auto-calibrated Grey Robotics IR sensors array for detecting the line 
with more accuracy. Two rechargeable batteries of 12 volts and 7Ah
were used as the power supply.
â€¢ Software Used: Arduino Programming Language.
